Twitch TC Challenge

User Stories: 

1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel
3. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
4. I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.


Hint: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Front-End-Project-Use-Twitchtv-JSON-API

Hint: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel

Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
